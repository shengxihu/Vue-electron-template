# Vue-electron-template
Got tired finding Electron/Vue2/Webpack2/Element templates with fancy add-ons you don't really need?

Give a try to this minimal template with very few dependencies for quick development and prototyping.

## Install
``` bash
# Clone the repository once
$ https://github.com/shengxihu/Vue-electron-template/

# Go into the repository (rename it as you wish)
$ cd Vue-electron-template

# Install the 7 only dependencies once
$ npm install
```

## Usage
Run this two commands in two different prompts to start developing with hot reloading.
``` bash
# Webpack builds once and watches to apply only the changes
$ npm run dev

# Start you electron app
$ npm start
```

## What's included
You don't really need more stuff to start playing around with Electron, Vue 2 and Webpack 2.

- Support for .vue (single file components). Use them with HTML & ES6 & CSS.
- No Express, neither Babel is needed (more than 97% ES6 is supported in Node/Electron).
